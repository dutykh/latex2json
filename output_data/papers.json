      "abstract": "We investigate the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of non-commutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue problem for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Our results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes. In addition, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild values for large mass parameters, validating our method's robustness. Our findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and non-commutative effects on black hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.",

      "abstract": "Freeze desalination is a promising alternative to conventional methods, offering energy-efficient and environmentally friendly solutions for freshwater production. This study presents theoretical modeling of a crystallizer to investigate the dynamics of continuous freeze desalination enhanced by ultrasound vibrations. A mathematical framework combining Navier-Stokes perturbation analysis with crystallization kinetics analyzes the interplay between fluid flow, heat transfer, and crystal growth under varying conditions. The model provides rapid, reliable predictions to support commercial scalability. Results show that increasing vibration velocity amplitudes and extending residence time improve both crystal growth and desalination efficiency. For example, at a vibration velocity amplitude of 12 m/s and a residence time of 135 s, desalination efficiency approaches 50 %, highlighting ultrasound's role in enhancing salt exclusion and crystallization rates. Temperature profiles along the crystallizer indicate that longer residence times allow greater cooling and impurity rejection, with freezing temperatures near the mushy zone approaching the eutectic point. The framework supports the design of scalable systems and fast control strategies to mitigate disturbances, maintain stability, and respond to variable freshwater demands. By linking theoretical modeling with experimental insights, this study advances the development of efficient, commercially viable freeze desalination technologies, offering a sustainable approach to addressing global water scarcity.",

      "abstract": "Earthquakes leave distinct signatures on lake systems, including event deposits that serve as valuable paleoseismological archives. Among these deposits, homogenite layers are commonly associated with lake oscillations, i.e., seiches. Here, we investigate the seiche mechanism and the formation of a homogenite related sediment deposit within a lacustrine environment. This study focuses on the 1822 CE earthquake in the Western European Alps, which triggered subaqueous landslides in Lake Bourget (France). This event caused oscillations in the lake's water, which subsequently resulted in the formation of a homogenite layer in the deep basin. The underlying mechanism is resolved by presenting the first comprehensive numerical model via coupling of coseismic displacement, seismic wave propagation, and mass movement with the tsunami model. The numerical simulations show excellent agreement with the available geological and historical observations. The water disturbances caused by subaqueous landslides generated small tsunami waves with a maximum runup height of approximately 2.5 m. By analyzing the tsunami signals using Fourier spectral analysis and fast iterative filtering, we determined that seismic waves are the primary drivers of seiche, which excite the natural modes of Lake Bourget. Our numerical results confirm that the sediments found in the deep basin originated from one main subaqueous landslide and from tsunami erosion of littoral sands (backwash). However, the seismically induced seiche was solely responsible for keeping the fine-grained sediment cloud in suspension for several days and led to the formation of the homogenite layer (or seiche deposit) with typical grain orientation characteristics. The proposed numerical framework could also be effective in identifying whether landslides or delta collapses (linked to homogenite/megaturbidites) in closed lakes were triggered by seismic or nonseismic sources. This distinction is crucial for reconstructing the history of past earthquakes and associated hazards.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript introduces an advanced numerical approach for the integration of incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a Time Series Expansion (TSE) method within a Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. The technique is enhanced by a novel stabilization strategy, incorporating a Divergent Series Resummation (DSR) technique, which significantly augments the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The stabilization mechanism is meticulously designed to improve the stability and validity of computed series terms, enabling the application of the Factorial Series (FS) algorithm for series resummation. This approach is pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with the accurate and stable numerical solution of NS equations, which are critical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The manuscript elaborates on the variational formulation of Stokes problem and present convergence analysis of the method using the Ladyzhenskaya-Babuvska-Brezzi (LBB) condition. It is followed by the NS equations and the implementation details of the stabilization technique, underscored by numerical tests on laminar flow past a cylinder, showcasing the method's efficacy and potential for broad applicability in fluid dynamics simulations. The results of the stabilization indicate a substantial enhancement in computational stability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue for future research in the field.",

      "abstract": "Using the spectral method, we investigate the scalar and axial quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massive static phantom wormholes. Our results reveal the existence of purely imaginary QNMs that were not identified in previous studies, suggesting potential (in)stabilities as the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius to the wormhole throat varies within a specific range. For scalar perturbations, instabilities arise when this ratio exceeds $1.0$, with the threshold value of $1.0$ itself included. In the case of axial perturbations, the onset of instability occurs at smaller ratios, reflecting the impact of gravitational waves on the wormhole's stability. The findings suggest that the wormhole remains stable when the throat size significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius. Our results align with existing literature but offer new insights into the stability conditions of phantom wormholes.",

      "abstract": "In this manuscript, we highlight a new phenomenon of complex algebraic singularity formation for solutions of a large class of genuinely nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). We start from a unique Cauchy datum, which is holomorphic ramified around the smooth locus and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian. Moreover, the singular locus S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers equation. Later, we state a general conjecture that describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state another Conjecture 2, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 2. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests that suggest that a Banach norm should exist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique. This work is a continuation of Leichtnam (1993).",

Here, we highlight its deep relationship with a generalized infinite hierarchy of the integrable Riemann-type hydrodynamic equations. A previous Lie symmetry analysis revealed a particular case which was conjectured to be integrable. Namely, a Lie-Baecklund symmetry exists, thus highlighting another associated dynamical system. Here, we investigate these two equations using the gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Moreover, we construct their infinite hierarchy of conservation laws analytically, using three compatible Poisson structures to prove the complete integrability of both dynamical systems. We investigate these two equations using the so-called gradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Based on this scheme, applied to the equation under consideration, we have analytically constructed its infinite hierarchy of conservation laws, derived two compatible Poisson structures and proved its complete integrability.",

      "abstract": "We propose a scheme to enhance the sensitivity of Non-Hermitian optomechanical mass-sensors. The benchmark system consists of two coupled optomechanical systems where the mechanical resonators are mechanically coupled. The optical cavities are driven either by a blue or red detuned laser to produce gain and loss, respectively. Moreover, the mechanical resonators are parametrically driven through the modulation of their spring constant. For a specific strength of the optical driving field and without parametric driving, the system features an Exceptional Point (EP). Any perturbation to the mechanical frequency (dissipation) induces a splitting (shifting) of the EP, which scales as the square root of the perturbation strength, resulting in a sensitivity-factor enhancement compared with conventional optomechanical sensors. The sensitivity enhancement induced by the shifting scenario is weak as compared to the one based on the splitting phenomenon. By switching on parametric driving, the sensitivity of both sensing schemes is greatly improved, yielding to a better performance of the sensor. We have also confirmed these results through an analysis of the output spectra and the transmissions of the optical cavities. In addition to enhancing EP sensitivity, our scheme also reveals nonlinear effects on sensing under splitting and shifting scenarii. This work sheds light on new mechanisms of enhancing the sensitivity of Non-Hermitian mass sensors, paving a way to improve sensors performance for better nanoparticles or pollutants detection, and for water treatment.",

This investigation revealed two distinct transitions into chaotic behaviour as the level of energy introduced into the system was incrementally increased. The initial transition manifests through a succession of bifurcations that adhere to the established Feigenbaum sequence. Conversely, the subsequent transition, which emerges at elevated levels of injected energy, is marked by a pronounced shift from quasi-periodic states to chaotic regimes. The genesis of the first chaotic state is predominantly attributed to the preeminence of inertial forces in governing nonlinear interactions. The second chaotic state, however, arises from the augmented significance of free surface elevation in the dynamical process. A novel reformulation of the system, employing phase and amplitude representations for each truncated variable, elucidated that the phase components present a temporal piece-wise locking behaviour by maintaining a constant value for a protracted interval, preceding an abrupt transition characterised by a simple rotation of ±π, even as the amplitudes display chaotic behaviour. It was observed that the duration of phase stability diminishes with an increase in injected energy, culminating in the onset of chaos within the phase components at high energy levels. This phenomenon is attributed to the nonlinear term of the equations, wherein the phase components are introduced through linear combinations of triads encompassing disparate modes. When the locking durations vary across modes, the resultant dynamics is a stochastic interplay of multiple π phase shifts, generating a stochastic dynamic within the coupled phase triads, observable even at minimal energy injections.",

      "abstract": "We present the irreversibility generated by a stationary cavity magnomechanical system composed of a yttrium iron garnet (YIG) sphere with a diameter of a few hundred micrometers inside a microwave cavity. In this system, the magnons, i.e., collective spin excitations in the sphere, are coupled to the cavity photon mode via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonon mode via magnetostrictive force (optomechanical-like). We employ the quantum phase space formulation of the entropy change to evaluate the steady-state entropy production rate and associated quantum correlation in the system. We find that the behavior of the entropy flow between the cavity photon mode and the phonon mode is determined by the magnon-photon coupling and the cavity photon dissipation rate. Interestingly, the entropy production rate can increase/decrease depending on the strength of the magnon-photon coupling and the detuning parameters. We further show that the amount of correlations between the magnon and phonon modes is linked to the irreversibility generated in the system for small magnon-photon coupling. Our results demonstrate the possibility of exploring irreversibility in driven magnon-based hybrid quantum systems and open a promising route for quantum thermal applications.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, Finite Element Method (FEM) has served as a foundational numerical framework for approximating the terms of Time Series Expansion (TSE) as solutions to transient Partial Differential Equation (PDE). However, the application of high-order Finite Element (FE) to certain classes of PDEs, such as diffusion equations and the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, often leads to numerical instabilities. These instabilities limit the number of valid terms in the series, though the efficiency of time series integration even when resummation techniques like the Borel-Padé-Laplace (BPL) integrators are employed. In this study, we introduce a novel variational formulation for computing the terms of a TSE associated with a given PDE using higher-order FEs. Our approach involves the incorporation of artificial diffusion terms on the left-hand side of the equations corresponding to each power in the series, serving as a stabilization technique. We demonstrate that this method can be interpreted as a minimization of an energy functional, wherein the total variations of the unknowns are considered. Furthermore, we establish that the coefficients of the artificial diffusion for each term in the series obey a recurrence relation, which can be determined by minimizing the condition number of the associated linear system. We highlight the link between the proposed technique and the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) of the heat equation. We show, via numerical experiments, how the proposed technique allows having additional valid terms of the series that will be substantial in enlarging the stability domain of the BPL integrators.",

      "abstract": "The current-voltage (I-V) curves of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been widely used as a tool to determine their electrical operation. Usually, I-V curves are described employing three cardinal points: the short-circuit point $\\left(0,I_\\mathrm{sc}\\right)$, the open-circuit point $\\left(V_\\mathrm{oc},0\\right)$, and the maximum power point $\\left(V_\\mathrm{mp},I_\\mathrm{mp} \\right)$. In this context, to study the I-V curves, the single-diode model (SDM) is often used. In this manuscript, we present a practical approach for determining the parameters domain of the SDM given a set of cardinal points. An in-depth mathematical analysis showed that the SDM must satisfy the following inequalities $\\frac{V_\\mathrm{oc}}{2} < V_\\mathrm{mp} &lt; V_\\mathrm{oc}$ and $\\frac{I_\\mathrm{sc}}{2} < I_\\mathrm{mp} < I_\\mathrm{sc}$. Then, it is possible to implicitly represent the SDM by a single parameter and, consequently, to determine its domain. For this purpose, a fast open-source computational algorithm for the single parameter domain of the SDM is presented. The algorithm has been computer-tested using $40\\,000$ synthetically generated maximum power points which are processed in about one minute of the CPU time on a standard laptop computer. Moreover, as practical applications, the databases from the California Energy Commission and the NREL are analyzed using the presented algorithm.",

Paleotsunamis studies play an essential role in understanding historical events and their consequences, along with their return periods. This study investigates a paleotsunami induced by a subaqueous mass movement during the Younger Dryas to Early Holocene transition, ca. 11,700 years ago in Lake Aiguebelette (NW Alps, France). Utilizing high-resolution seismic and bathymetric surveys associated with sedimentological, geochemical, and magnetic analyses, we uncovered a paleotsunami triggered by a seismically induced mass transport deposit. Numerical simulations of mass movement have been conducted using a visco-plastic Herschel-Bulkley rheological model and corresponding tsunami wave modeled with dispersive and nondispersive models. Our findings reveal for the first time that dispersive effects may be negligible for subaqueous landslides in a relatively small lake. This research reconstructs a previously unreported paleotsunami event and enhances our understanding of tsunami dynamics in lacustrine environments.",

      "abstract": "We propose a scheme to achieve magnon (photon) blockade by using magnon squeezing within a cavity magnomechanical system under weak pump driving. Under ideal conditions, we observe a substantial magnon blockade effect, as well as simultaneous photon blockade. Moreover, both numerical and analytical results match perfectly, providing robust evidence of consistency. In addition to calculating optimal parametric gain and detuning values, we can improve the second-order correlation function. The proposed scheme will be a pioneering approach towards magnon (photon) blockade in experimental cavity magnomechanical systems.",

      "abstract": "Muscle fatigue is the decay in the ability of muscles to generate force, and results from neural and metabolic perturbations. This article presents an integrative mathematical model that describes the decrease in maximal force capacity (i.e. fatigue) over exercises performed at intensities above the critical force Fc (i.e. severe domain). The model unifies the previous Critical Power Model and All-Out Model and can be applied to any exercise described by a changing force F over time. The assumptions of the model are (i) isokinetic conditions, an intensity domain of Fc < F, (ii) constant individual parameters of Fc and tau (iii) fatigability proportional to the accumulation of impulse Jac above the critical force Fc. The present study adjusted the parameters to fit previous experimental observations from three types of exercises: constant intensity, all-out, and increasing ramp exercise. This integrative model establishes a connection between the previous individual models and provides an excellent description of exercise fatigability in the severe domain. With this new integrative model, the maximal force production of the muscle can be predicted over time during both maximal and submaximal exercises.",

Our intention in this work is to present a simple analytical model to simulate and study water-wave scattering by evaluating reflection coefficients. Further, our challenge is to present an analytical model that can easily investigate simultaneously the effects of rectangular submerged obstacles/and submarine trenches on wave scattering. Furthermore, reflection coefficients are investigated for different immersion ratios and relative lengths simultaneously for submarine trenches/and rectangular submerged obstacles. In addition, to ensure the validity of the presented model, our results are well compared with those of the literature. Finally, a comparison of reflection coefficients associated with the interactions of waves with rectangular submerged obstacles/and submarine trenches are presented to investigate the most efficient breakwater, and to highlight the importance of the presented model.",

In particular, there are constructed its Lax type repreentation, the Hamiltonian symmetries as flows on a functional manifold endowed with compatible Poisson structures as well as so called new mysterious symmetries, depending on functional parameter. Similar results are also presented for the potential-KdVdynamical system, for which we also obtained its new mysterious symmetries first presented in a clear, enough short and analytically readable form.",

We briefly recall how this family is correlated to the problem of Lehmer. A variety of questions is raised about their numbers of zeroes in F_p and their factorizations, via Kronecker's Average Value Theorem (viewed as an analog of classical Theorems of Uniform Distribution Theory). These questions are partially answered using results of Schinzel, revisited by Sawin, Shusterman and Stoll, and density theorems (Frobenius, Chebotarev, Serre, Rosen). These questions arise from the search for the existence of integer polynomials of Mahler measure > 1 less than the smallest Salem number 1.176280. Explicit connection with modular forms (or modular representations) of the numbers of zeroes of these polynomials in F_p is obtained in a few cases. In general it is expected since it must exist according to the Langlands program.",

Comparing with the greedy algorithm, minimal and maximal alphabets are defined. The maximal alphabets are shown to be correlated to the asymptotics of the Pierce numbers of the base β and Lehmer's problem. The notion of rewriting trail is introduced to construct intermediate alphabets associated with small polynomial values of the base. Consequences on the representations of neighbourhoods of the origin in Q(β), generalizing Schmidt's theorem related to Pisot numbers, are investigated. Applications to Galois conjugation are given for convergent sequences of bases γ s := γ n,m 1 ,...,m s such that γ −1 s is the unique root in (0, 1) of an almost Newman polynomial of the type −1 + x + x^n + x^(m_1) +. .. + x_(m_s) , n ≥ 3, s ≥ 1, m_1 − n ≥ n − 1, m_(q+1) − m_q ≥ n − 1 for all q ≥ 1. For β &gt; 1 a reciprocal algebraic integer close to one, the poles of modulus &lt; 1 of the dynamical zeta function of the β-shift ζ_β (z) are shown, under some assumptions, to be zeroes of the minimal polynomial of β .",

In doing so they made a number of quite reasonable assumptions, incompressibility of the water and irrotational fluid. The resulting equation, the celebrated KdV equation, has been shown to be a very reasonable description of real water waves. However there are other phenomena which have an impact on the shape of the wave, that of vorticity and viscosity. This paper examines how a constant vorticity affects the shape of waves in electrohydrodynamics. For constant vorticity, the vertical component of the velocity obeys a Laplace equation and also has the usual lower boundary condition. In making the vertical component of the velocity take central stage, the Burns condition can be thus bypassed.",

The upper region is governed by inviscid Euler equations, while the bottom region (the so-called boundary layer) is described by Navier-Stokes equations. We consider a particular regime linking the Reynolds number and the shallowness parameter. The computations presented in this note are performed in the fully nonlinear regime. The boundary layer flow reduces to a Prandtl-like equation that we claim to be irreducible. Further approximations seem to be needed to obtain a tractable model.",

      "abstract": "Application of nonlinear dispersion wave hydrodynamics (NLD-) models for solving practical problems constantly stimulates the search for ways to expand their field of applicability and achieve a more accurate reproduction of the characteristics of the simulated processes. A productive step in this direction turned out to be the method proposed by Madsen & Sørensen (1992), which made it possible to increase the approximation order of the dispersion relation of the Peregrine model while preserving the third order of derivatives included in the original equations and the second order of long-wave approximation. Later, other approaches were proposed to achieve this goal, which had a noticeable effect on expanding the field of applicability of NLD-models (for example, Nwogu (1993), Beji & Nadaoka (1996)). In the present work, we set a similar goal — to improve the properties of the dispersion relation of the model (and, therefore, the phase velocity), providing the Pade approximation (2,2) of the dispersion relation of the 3D model of potential flows. In contrast to earlier works on this subject, where weakly non-linear models were considered, we proceed from the fully nonlinear weakly dispersive two-dimensional Serre — Green — Naghdi (SGN-) model. The novelty of the proposed method consists in modifying the formula for the non-hydrostatic part of the pressure, while the accuracy of the long-wave approximation is preserved. It is shown that in some special cases the obtained fully nonlinear model is close to the known models (for example, after appropriate simplification it coincides with the model from Beji & Nadaoka (1996)). A dispersion analysis was performed one of the results of which was the conclusion that for sufficiently long waves the approximation order of the dispersion relation of the 3D model increases from the second to the fourth and an improvement was also achieved for more short waves. The proposed modification of the SGN-model is invariant with respect to the Galilean transformation; the law of conservation of mass and the law of balance of the total momentum are satisfied. However, the law of conservation of total energy is not satisfied. Apparently all NLD-models with improved dispersion characteristics possess this negative quality.",

Mitsotakis, is employed here in order to model the generation and propagation of surface water waves over variable bottom. The simplification consists in applying the so-called Boussinesq approximation. Using the finite element method and the FreeFem++ software, we solve numerically this system for three different complexities for the bathymetry function: a flat bottom case, a variable bottom in space, and a variable bottom both in space and in time. The last case is illustrated with the Java 2006 tsunami event. This article is designed rather as a tutorial paper even if it contains the description of completely new adaptation techniques.",

In the beginning we recall what is known about the dynamic cascades for the classical KdV (quadratic) and mKdV (cubic) equations. Then, we investigate further the mKdV case by considering a richer set of initial perturbations in order to check the validity and persistence of various facts previously established for the narrow-banded perturbations. Afterwards we focus on higher order nonlinearities (quartic and quintic) which are found to be quite different in many respects from the mKdV equation. Throughout this study we consider both the direct and double energy cascades. It was found that the dynamic cascade is always formed, but its formation is not necessarily accompanied by the nonlinear stage of the modulational instability. Direct cascade structure remains invariant regardless the size of the spectral domain. In contrast, the double cascade shape can depend on the size of the spectral domain, even if the total number of cascading modes remains invariant. Results obtained in this study can be potentially applied to plasmas, free surface and internal wave hydrodynamics.",

The bathymetry consists of the section of a constant depth, which is matched with the beach of constant slope. To address different levels of nonlinearity, the time series with five different significant wave heights are considered. The selected wave parameters allow also seeing the effects of wave breaking on wave statistics. The total physical time of each simulated time-series is 1000 hours (~360000 wave periods). The statistics of calculated wave runup heights are discussed with respect to the wave nonlinearity, wave breaking and the bandwidth of the incoming wave field. The conditional Weibull distribution is suggested as a model for the description of extreme runup heights and assessment of extreme inundations.",

Namely, for suitably chosen values of detuning the variation range of amplitudes can be significantly wider than for exact resonance. Moreover, the range of energy variation is not symmetric with respect to the sign of the detuning. Finally, the period of the energy oscillation exhibits non-monotonic dependency on the magnitude of detuning. These results have important theoretical implications where nonlinear resonance analysis is involved, such as geophysics, plasma physics, fluid dynamics. Numerous practical applications are envisageable \\eg in energy harvesting systems.",

      "abstract": "This article proposes an efficient explicit numerical model with a relaxed stability condition for the simulation of heat, air and moisture transfer in porous material. Three innovative approaches are combined to solve the system of three partial differential equations. The Du Fort-Frankel scheme is used to solve the diffusion equation, providing an explicit scheme with an extended stability region. The two advection--diffusion equations are solved using both Scharfetter-Gummel numerical scheme for the space discretisation and the two-step Runge-Kutta method for the time variable. This combination enables to relax the stability condition by one order. The proposed numerical model is evaluated on three case studies. The first one considers quasi-linear coefficients to confirm the theoretical results by numerical computations. The stability condition is relaxed by a factor of 40 compared to the standard approach. The second case provides an analytical solution for weakly nonlinear problem. A very satisfactory accuracy is observed between the reference solution and the one provided by the numerical model. The last case study assumes more realistic application with nonlinear coefficients and Robin-type boundary conditions. The computational time is reduced 10 times by using the proposed model in comparison with the explicit Euler method.",

      "abstract": "The reliability of mathematical models for heat and mass transfer in building porous material is of capital importance. A reliable model permits to carry predictions of the physical phenomenon with sufficient confidence in the results. Among the physical phenomena, the hysteresis effects on moisture sorption and moisture capacity need to be integrated in the mathematical model of transfer. This article proposes to explore the use of an smooth Bang-Bang model to simulate the hysteresis effects coupled with heat and mass transfer in porous material. This model adds two supplementary differential equations to the two classical ones for heat and mass transfer. The solution of these equations ensures smooth transitions between the main sorption and desorption curves. Two parameters are required to control the speed of transition through the intermediary curves. After the mathematical description of the model, an efficient numerical model is proposed to compute the fields with accuracy and reduced computational efforts. It is based on the Du Fort-Frankel scheme for the heat and mass balance equations. For the hysteresis numerical model, an innovative implicit-explicit approach is proposed. Then, the predictions of the numerical model are compared with experimental observations from literature for two case studies. The first one corresponds to a slow cycle of adsorption and desorption while the second is based on a fast cycling case with alternative increase and decrease of moisture content. The comparisons highlight a very satisfactory agreement between the numerical predictions and the observations. In the last Section, the reliability and efficiency of the proposed model is investigated for long term simulation cases. The importance of considering hysteresis effects in the reliability of the predictions are enhanced by comparison with classical approaches from literature.",

      "abstract": "The lack of offshore seismic data caused uncertainties associated to understating the behavior of future tsunamigenic earthquakes in the Makran Subduction Zone (MSZ). Future tsunamigenic events in the MSZ may trigger significant near-field tsunamis. Run-up heights in the near-field are controlled by the heterogeneity of slip over the rupture area. Considering a non-planar geometry for the Makran subduction zone, a range of random k^{-2} slip models were generated to hypothesize rupturing on the fault zone. We model tsunamis numerically and assess probabilistic tsunami hazard in the near-field for all synthetic scenarios. The main affected areas by tsunami waves are the area between Jask and Ormara along the shorelines of Iran and Pakistan and the area between Muscat and Sur along the Oman coastline. The maximum peak-run-up along the shores of Iran and Pakistan is about 16 m and about 12 m for the Oman shoreline. The slip distributions control the run-up along the Makran coastlines. The dependency of run-up to the heterogeneity of slip is higher in the most impacted areas. Those areas are more vulnerable to tsunami hazard than other areas.",

The experiments are carried out in a two-dimensional wave flume and wave trains derived from Pierson-Moskowitz and JONSWAP spectrum are generated. The peak frequency does not change during the wave train propagation for Pierson-Moskowitz waves; however, a downshift of this peak is observed for JONSWAP waves. An energy partitioning is performed in order to track the spatial evolution of energy. Four energy regions are defined for each spectrum type. A nonlinear energy transfer between different spectral regions as the wave train propagates is demonstrated and quantified. Numerical simulations are conducted using a modified Boussinesq model for long waves in shallow waters of varying depth. Experimental results are in satisfactory agreement with numerical predictions, especially in the case of wave trains derived from JONSWAP spectrum.",

      "abstract": "Predictions of physical phenomena in buildings are carried out by using physical models formulated as a mathematical problem and solved by means of numerical methods, aiming at evaluating, for instance, the building thermal or hygrothermal performance by calculating distributions and fluxes of heat and moisture transfer. Therefore, the choice of the numerical method is crucial since it is a compromise among (i) the solution accuracy, (ii) the computational cost to obtain the solution and (iii) the complexity of the method implementation. An efficient numerical method enables to compute an accurate solution with a minimum computational run time (CPU). On that account, this article brings an investigation on the performance of three numerical methods. The first one is the standard and widely used finite-difference approach, while the second one is the so-called RC approach, which is a particular method brought to the building physics area by means of an analogy of electric circuits. The third numerical method is the spectral one, which has been recently proposed to solve nonlinear diffusive problems in building physics. The three methods are evaluated in terms of accuracy on the assessment of the dependent variable (temperature or vapor pressure) or of density of fluxes for three different cases: i) heat diffusion through a concrete slab, ii) moisture diffusion through an aerated concrete slab and iii) heat diffusion using measured temperatures as boundary conditions. Results highlight the spectral approach as the most accurate method. The RC based model with a few number of resistances does not provide accurate results for temperature and vapor pressure distributions neither to flux densities nor conduction loads.",

The general mathematical formulation for this problem is presented in the framework of a hierarchy of mathematical models. Namely, in this first part we formulate the problem at every hierarchical level. The special attention is payed to fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive models since they are most likely to be used in practice. For this model we have to consider separately the inner (under the body) and outer domains. Various approached to the gluing of solutions at the boundary is discussed as well. We propose several strategies which ensure the global conservation or continuity of some important physical quantities.",

Such is, for instance, the case of the Population Balance Equations (PBE) proposed to model the Latex Particles Morphology formation. The obvious way out of this difficulty is the use of dimensionless scaled quantities, although often the scaling procedure is not unique. In this paper, we introduce a conceptually new general approach, called Optimal Scaling (OS). The method is tested on the known examples from classical and quantum mechanics, and applied to the Latex Particles Morphology model, where it allows us to reduce the variation of the relevant coefficients from 49 to just 4 orders of magnitudes. The PBE are then solved by a novel Generalised Method Of Characteristics, and the OS is shown to help reduce numerical error, and avoid unphysical behaviour of the solution. Although inspired by a particular application, the proposed scaling algorithm is expected find application in a wide range of chemical, physical and biological problems.",

      "abstract": "The estimate of individual wave run-up is especially important for tsunami warning and risk assessment as it allows to evaluate the inundation area. Here as a model of tsunami we use the long single wave of positive polarity. The period of such wave is rather long which makes it different from the famous Korteweg-de Vries soliton. This wave nonlinearly deforms during its propagation in the ocean, what results in a steep wave front formation. Situations, when waves approach the coast with a steep front are often observed during large tsunamis, e.g. 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 15 Tohoku tsunamis. Here we study the nonlinear deformation and run-up of long single waves of positive polarity in the conjoined water basin, which consists of the constant depth section and a plane beach. The work is performed numerically and analytically in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water theory. Analytically, wave propagation along the constant depth section and its run-up on a beach are considered independently without taking into account wave interaction with the toe of the bottom slope. The propagation along the bottom of constant depth is described by Riemann wave, while the wave 20 run-up on a plane beach is calculated using rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow water theory following the Carrier-Greenspan approach. Numerically, we use the finite volume method with the second order UNO2 reconstruction in space and the third order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps. During wave propagation along the constant depth section, the wave becomes asymmetric with a steep wave front. Shown, that the maximum run-up height depends on the front steepness of the incoming wave approaching the toe of the bottom slope. The corresponding formula for maximum 25 run-up height, which takes into account the wave front steepness, is proposed.",

If discretized naively, this equation may represent serious numerical difficulties since the diffusion coefficient is practically unbounded and most of its solutions are weakly divergent at the origin. In order to overcome these difficulties we reformulate this equation using some ideas from the Lagrangian fluid mechanics. This allows us to obtain a numerical scheme with a rather generous stability condition. Finally, the algorithm admits an elegant implementation and the corresponding Matlab code is provided with this article under an open source license.",

      "abstract": "The regularisation of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws has been a problem of great importance for achieving uniqueness of weak solutions and also for accurate numerical simulations. In a recent work, the first two authors proposed a so-called Hamiltonian regularisation for nonlinear shallow water and isentropic Euler equations. The characteristic property of this method is that the regularisation of solutions is achieved without adding any artificial dissipation or dispersion. The regularised system possesses a Hamiltonian structure and, thus, formally preserves the corresponding energy functional. In the present article we generalise this approach to shallow water waves over general, possibly time-dependent, bottoms. The proposed system is solved numerically with continuous Galerkin method and its solutions are compared with the analogous solutions of the classical shallow water and dispersive Serre-Green-Naghdi equations. The numerical results confirm the absence of dispersive and dissipative effects in presence of bathymetry variations.",

      "abstract": "The fidelity of a model relies both on its accuracy to predict the physical phenomena and its capability to estimate unknown parameters using observations. This article focuses on this second aspect by analyzing the reliability of two mathematical models proposed in the literature for the simulation of heat losses through building walls. The first one, named DuFort-Frankel (DF), is the classical heat diffusion equation combined with the DuFort-Frankel numerical scheme. The second is the so-called RC lumped approach, based on a simple ordinary differential equation to compute the temperature within the wall. The reliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of observations are generated using a pseudo-spectral numerical model for the heat diffusion equation with known input parameters. The results are then modified by adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements. Then, for each sample of observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the two mathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the approach to recover the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered for the estimation of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal conductivity or (iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the wall and the ambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory reliability to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the RC model lacks of fidelity and reliability. The error on the estimated parameter can reach 40% for the heat capacity, 80% for the thermal conductivity and 450% for the heat transfer coefficient.",

      "abstract": "The issue to predict the behavior of building materials during wide horizons of time is still challenging. Experimental set-ups, since they require to perform tests for several years, are costly, never at the full scale and inconvenient. Building Performance Simulation (BPS) programs are designed to perform predictions on computational machines and cut experimental costs significantly. Nonetheless, in the recent review of state-of-the-art, it was indicated that despite the wide range of programs, there are still some drawbacks in terms of the accuracy and the high computational cost. This paper investigates the application of an innovative numerical method, called Super-Time-Stepping (STS) method. It allows performing accurate simulations with time-steps much larger than with standard explicit approaches. These \"super\" time-steps also enable us to reduce the computational cost. In addition to that, the design of the method allows easier application for models in higher dimensions and with nonlinear parameters. The efficiency of the method is tested on linear and nonlinear academic cases. Further study for the reliability of the model is performed on an experimental case study. The experiment has been carried out on a rammed earth wall during almost 14 months. Obtained data is presented in this article and implemented into proposed model. As a result of the case studies, it is shown that in comparison to the Euler explicit method, the STS methods can cut costs by more than five times while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency. A very fine analysis of the physical phenomena is also performed.",

Namely, we consider the two-component Camassa-Holm equations, the Zakharov-Ito system and the Kaup--Boussinesq equations all including constant vorticity effects. We analyze both solitary and periodic-type travelling waves using the simple and geometrically intuitive phase space analysis. We get the pulse-type solitary wave solutions and the front solitary wave solutions. For the Zakharov-Ito system we underline the occurrence of the pulse and anti-pulse solutions. The front wave solutions decay algebraically in the far field. For the Kaup-Boussinesq system, interesting analytical multi-pulsed travelling wave solutions are found.",

The underlying finite volume scheme is conservative and it is accurate up to the second order in space. The main novelty consists in the motion of the grid. This new dynamic aspect can be used to resolve better the areas with large solution gradients or any other special features. No interpolation procedure is employed, thus unnecessary solution smearing is avoided, and therefore, our method enjoys excellent conservation properties. The resulting grid is completely redistributed according the choice of the so-called monitor function. Several more or less universal choices of the monitor function are provided. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on several examples stemming from the simple linear advection to the simulation of complex shallow water waves. The exact well-balanced property is proven. We believe that the techniques described in our paper can be beneficially used to model tsunami wave propagation and run-up.",

The equation he postulated which is now called the Whitham equation has recently been extended to a system of equations allowing for bi-directional propagation of surface waves. A number of different two-way systems have been put forward, and even though they are similar from a modeling point of view, these systems have very different mathematical properties. In the current work, we review some of the existing fully dispersive systems. We use state-of-the-art numerical tools to try to understand existence and stability of solutions to the initial-value problem associated to these systems. We also put forward a new system which is Hamiltonian and semi-linear. The new system is shown to perform well both with regard to approximating the full Euler system, and with regard to well posedness properties.",

We aimed at computing the coupling conditions for a 1D effective model, using 2D simulations and an analysis based on the conservation laws. For small amplitudes, this analysis justifies the well-known Stoker interface conditions, so that the coupling does not depend on the angle of the fork. We also find this in the numerical solution. Large amplitude solutions in a symmetric fork also tend to follow Stoker's relations, due to the symmetry constraint. For non symmetric forks, 2D effects dominate so that it is necessary to understand the flow inside the fork. However, even then, conservation laws give some insight in the dynamics.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with an inverse problem applied to the field of building physics to experimentally estimate three sorption isotherm coefficients of a wood fiber material. First, the mathematical model, based on convective transport of moisture, the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) and the experimental set-up are presented. Then measurements of relative humidity within the material are carried out, after searching the OED, which is based on the computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown parameters employed in the mathematical model. The OED enables to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. Two experimental procedures were identified: i) single step of relative humidity from 10% to 75% and ii) multiple steps of relative humidity 10-75-33-75% with an 8-day duration period for each step. For both experiment designs, it has been shown that the sensor has to be placed near the impermeable boundary. After the measurements, the parameter estimation problem is solved using an interior point algorithm to minimize the cost function. Several tests are performed for the definition of the cost function, by using the L^2 or L^\\infty norm and considering the experiments separately or at the same time. It has been found out that the residual between the experimental data and the numerical model is minimized when considering the discrete Euclidean norm and both experiments separately. It means that two parameters are estimated using one experiment while the third parameter is determined with the other experiment. Two cost functions are defined and minimized for this approach. Moreover, the algorithm requires less than 100 computations of the direct model to obtain the solution. In addition, the OED sensitivity functions enable to capture an approximation of the probability distribution function of the estimated parameters. The determined sorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the experimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the model does not take into account the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity. Therefore, the model is improved proposing a second differential equation for the sorption capacity to take into account the hysteresis between the main adsorption and desorption curves. The OED approach is also illustrated for the estimation of five of the coefficients involved in the hysteresis model. To conclude, the prediction of the model with hysteresis are compared with the experimental observations to illustrate the improvement of the prediction.",

      "abstract": "The numerical simulation of nonlinear dispersive waves is a central research topic of many investigations in the nonlinear wave community. Simple and robust solvers are needed for numerical studies of water waves as well. The main difficulties arise in the numerical approximation of high order derivatives and in severe stability restrictions on the time step, when explicit schemes are used. In this study we propose new relaxed system formulations which approximate the initial dispersive wave equation. However, the resulting relaxed system involves first order derivatives only and it is written in the form of an evolution problem. Thus, many standard methods can be applied to solve the relaxed problem numerically. In this article we illustrate the application of the new relaxed scheme on the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation as a prototype of stiff dispersive PDEs.",

      "abstract": "In the present article we consider the problem of underwater avalanches propagating over moderate slopes. The main goal of our work is to investigate the avalanche front velocity selection mechanism when it propagates downwards. In particular, we show that the front velocity does not depend univocally on the mass of sediments. This phenomenon is investigated and explained in our study. Moreover, we derive from the first principles a depth-averaged model. Then, we assume that sediments are uniformly distributed along the slope. In this case, they can be entrained into the flow head and a self-sustained regime can be established. One of the main findings of our study is that the avalanche front velocity is not unique due to a hysteresis phenomenon. We attempt to explain this phenomenon using dynamical systems considerations.",

Nevertheless, building insulation can generate high expenditures so that the selection of an optimum insulation thickness requires a detailed energy simulation as well as an economic analysis. In this way, the present study proposes an innovative non-uniform adaptive method to determine the optimal insulation thickness of external walls. First, the method is compared with a reference solution to properly understand the features of the method, which can provide high accuracy with less spatial nodes. Then, the adaptive method is used to simulate the transient heat conduction through the building envelope of buildings located in Brazil, where there is a large potential of energy reduction. Simulations have been efficiently carried out for different wall and roof configurations, showing that the innovative method efficiently provides a gain of 25% on the computer run time.",

      "abstract": "This work presents an efficient numerical method based on spectral expansions for simulation of heat and moisture diffusive transfers through multilayered porous materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the problem is discretized in time and space domains (Method of lines) to obtain a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), which is computationally expensive. To avoid such a cost, this paper proposes a reduced-order method that is faster and accurate, using a much smaller system of ODEs. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, tree case studies are presented. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer. The second case - highly nonlinear - imposes a high moisture content gradient - simulating a rain like condition - over a two-layered domain, while the last one compares the numerical prediction against experimental data for validation purposes. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily and naturally treated with the spectral reduced-order method. Concerning the reliability part, predictions show a good agreement with experimental results, which confirm robustness, calculation efficiency and high accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting the coupled heat and moisture transfer through porous materials.",

      "abstract": "This work presents a detailed mathematical model combined with an innovative efficient numerical model to predict heat, air and moisture transfer through porous building materials. The model considers the transient effects of air transport and its impact on the heat and moisture transfer. The achievement of the mathematical model is detailed in the continuity of Luikov's work. A system composed of two advection-diffusion differential equations plus one exclusively diffusion equation is derived. The main issue to take into account the transient air transfer arises in the very small characteristic time of the transfer, implying very fine discretisation. To circumvent these difficulties, the numerical model is based on the Du Fort-Frankel explicit and unconditionally stable scheme for the exclusively diffusion equation. It is combined with a two-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time with the Scharfetter-Gummel numerical scheme in space for the coupled advection-diffusion equations. At the end, the numerical model enables to relax the stability condition, and, therefore, to save important computational efforts. A validation case is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the model for a nonlinear problem. Results highlight a very accurate solution computed about 16 times faster than standard approaches. After this numerical validation, the reliability of the mathematical model is evaluated by comparing the numerical predictions to experimental observations. The latter is measured within a multi-layered wall submitted to a sudden increase of vapor pressure on the inner side and driven climate boundary conditions on the outer side. A very satisfactory agreement is noted between the numerical predictions and experimental observations indicating an overall good reliability of the proposed model.",

The Spectral approach is an a priori method assuming a separated representation of the solution. The method is compared with both classical Euler implicit and Crank-Nicolson schemes, considered as large original models. Their performance - in terms of accuracy, complexity reduction and CPU time reduction - are discussed for linear and nonlinear cases of moisture diffusive transfer through single and multi-layered one-dimensional domains, considering highly moisture-dependent properties. Results show that the Spectral reduced-order model approach enables to simulate accurately the field of interest. Furthermore, numerical gains become particularly interesting for nonlinear cases since the proposed method can drastically reduce the computer run time, by a factor of 100, when compared to the traditional Crank-Nicolson scheme for one-dimensional applications.",

However, the proliferation of various Boussinesq-type systems started only in the second half of the XXst century. Today they come under various flavours depending on the goals of the modeller. At the beginning of the XXIst century an effort to classify such systems, at least for even bottoms, was undertaken and developed according to both different physical regimes and mathematical properties, with special emphasis, in this last sense, on the existence of symmetry groups and their connection to conserved quantities. Of particular interest are those systems admitting a symplectic structure, with the subsequent preservation of the total energy represented by the Hamiltonian. In the present paper a family of Boussinesq-type systems with multi-symplectic structure is introduced. Some properties of the new systems are analyzed: their relation with already known Boussinesq models, the identification of those systems with additional Hamiltonian structure as well as other mathematical features like well-posedness and existence of different types of solitary-wave solutions. The consistency of multi-symplectic systems with the full Euler equations is also discussed.",

A polynomial having its coefficients in {0, 1} except its constant coefficient equal to -1 is called an almost Newman polynomial. A general theorem of factorization of the almost Newman polynomials of the class B is obtained. Such polynomials possess lenticular roots in the open unit disk off the unit circle in the small angular sector \\pi/18 <= arg z <= \\pi/18 and their nonreciprocal parts are always irreducible. The existence of lenticuli of roots is a peculiarity of the class B. By comparison with the Odlyzko - Poonen Conjecture and its variant Conjecture, an ``Asymptotic Reducibility Conjecture'' is formulated aiming at establishing the proportion of irreducible polynomials in this class.

      "abstract": "This work presents an alternative view on the numerical simulation of diffusion processes applied to the heat and moisture transfer through porous building materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the discretization follows the Method Of Lines (MOL), when the problem is first discretized in space to obtain a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Thus, this paper proposes to change this viewpoint. First, we discretize in time to obtain a small system of coupled ODEs, which means instead of having a Cauchy (Initial Value) Problem (IVP), we have a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). Fortunately, BVPs can be solved efficiently today using adaptive collocation methods of high order. To demonstrate the benefits of this new approach, three case studies are presented, in which one of them is compared with experimental data. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer while the second one considers two material layers. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily treated, by reasonably using a fourth-order adaptive method. Finally, the last case study compares numerical results with experimental measurements, showing a good agreement.",

      "abstract": "It is of great concern to produce numerically efficient methods for moisture diffusion through porous media, capable of accurately calculate moisture distribution with a reduced computational effort. In this way, model reduction methods are promising approaches to bring a solution to this issue since they do not degrade the physical model and provide a significant reduction of computational cost. Therefore, this article explores in details the capabilities of two model-reduction techniques - the Spectral Reduced-Order Model (Spectral-ROM) and the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) - to numerically solve moisture diffusive transfer through porous materials. Both approaches are applied to three different problems to provide clear examples of the construction and use of these reduced-order models. The methodology of both approaches is explained extensively so that the article can be used as a numerical benchmark by anyone interested in building a reduced-order model for diffusion problems in porous materials. Linear and non-linear unsteady behaviors of unidimensional moisture diffusion are investigated. The last case focuses on solving a parametric problem in which the solution depends on space, time and the diffusivity properties. Results have highlighted that both methods provide accurate solutions and enable to reduce significantly the order of the model around ten times lower than the large original model. It also allows an efficient computation of the physical phenomena with an error lower than 10^{-2} when compared to a reference solution.",

In 1945, the Makran subduction zone (MSZ) generated a tsunamigenic earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1. The region has also experienced large historical earthquakes but the data regarding these events are poorly documented. Therefore, the need to investigate tsunamis in Makran must be taken into serious consideration. Using hydrodynamic numerical simulation, we evaluate the tsunami wave energy generated by bottom motion for a tsunamigenic source model distributed along the full length of the Makran subduction zone. The whole rupture of the plate boundary is divided into 20 segments with width of order of 200 km and a co-seismic slip of 10 m but with various lengths. Exchanges between kinetic and potential components of tsunami wave energy are shown. The total tsunami wave energy displays only 0.33% of the seismic energy released from the earthquake source. As a result, for every increase in magnitude by one unit, the associated tsunami wave energy becomes about 10^3 times greater.",

It also depends on the model's ability to estimate relevant parameters using observations of the physical phenomena. In this paper, the reliability of the VTT model is investigated under these two criteria for various given temperature and relative humidity constant in time. First of all, experiments are conducted on bamboo fiberboard. Using these data, five parameters of the VTT model, defining the mold vulnerability class of a material, are identified. The results highlight that the determined parameters are not within the range of the classes defined in the VTT model. In addition, the quality of the parameter estimation is not satisfactory. Then the sensitivity of the numerical results of the VTT model is analyzed by varying an input parameter. These investigations show that the VTT mathematical formulation of the physical model of mold growth is not reliable. An improved model is proposed with a new mathematical formulation. It is inspired by the logistic equation whose parameters are estimated using the experimental data obtained. The parameter estimation is very satisfactory. In the last parts of the paper, the numerical predictions of the improved model are compared to experimental data from the literature to prove its reliability.",

      "abstract": "We consider a scalar Hamiltonian nonlinear wave equation formulated on networks; this is a non standard problem because these domains are not locally homeomorphic to any subset of the Euclidean space. More precisely, we assume each edge to be a 1D uniform line with end points identified with graph vertices. The interface conditions at these vertices are introduced and justified using conservation laws and an homothetic argument. We present a detailed methodology based on a symplectic finite difference scheme together with a special treatment at the junctions to solve the problem and apply it to the sine-Gordon equation. Numerical results on a simple graph containing four loops show the performance of the scheme for kinks and breathers initial conditions.",

Dissipative effects due to the viscous nature of the fluid are also taken into account. The new models validate by asymptotic reasoning other non-dispersive systems of equations that are commonly used, and improve other nonlinear and dispersive mathematical models derived to describe the blood flow in elastic vessels. The new systems are studied analytically in terms of their basic characteristic properties such as the linear dispersion characteristics, symmetries, conservation laws and solitary waves. Unidirectional model equations are also derived and analysed in the case of vessels of constant radius. The capacity of the models to be used in practical problems is being demonstrated by employing a particular system with favourable properties to study the blood flow in a large artery. Two different cases are considered: A vessel with constant radius and a tapered vessel. Significant changes in the flow can be observed in the case of the tapered vessel.",

      "abstract": "Comparisons of experimental observation of heat and moisture transfer through porous building materials with numerical results have been presented in numerous studies reported in literature. However, some discrepancies have been observed, highlighting underestimation of sorption process and overestimation of desorption process. Some studies intend to explain the discrepancies by analysing the importance of hysteresis effects as well as carrying out sensitivity analyses on the input parameters as convective transfer coefficients. This article intends to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled solution by adding advective transfer of both heat and moisture in the physical model. In addition, the efficient Scharfetter and Gummel numerical scheme is proposed to solve the system of advection-diffusion equations, which has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserving. Moreover, the scheme is particularly efficient in terms of accuracy and reduction of computational time when using large spatial discretisation parameters. Several linear and non-linear cases are studied to validate the method and highlight its specific features. At the end, an experimental benchmark from the literature is considered. The numerical results are compared to the experimental data for a pure diffusive model and also for the proposed model. The latter presents better agreement with the experimental data. The influence of the hysteresis effects on the moisture capacity is also studied, by adding a third differential equation.",

      "abstract": "Implicit schemes require important sub-iterations when dealing with highly nonlinear problems such as the combined heat and moisture transfer through porous building elements. The computational cost rises significantly when the whole-building is simulated, especially when there is important coupling among the building elements themselves with neighbouring zones and with HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) systems. On the other hand, the classical Euler explicit scheme is generally not used because its stability condition imposes very fine time discretisation. Hence, this paper explores the use of an improved explicit approach - the Dufort-Frankel scheme - to overcome the disadvantage of the classical explicit one and to bring benefits that cannot be obtained by implicit methods. The Dufort-Frankel approach is first compared to the classical Euler implicit and explicit schemes to compute the solution of nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials. Then, the analysis of the Dufort-Frankel unconditionally stable explicit scheme is extended to the coupled heat and moisture balances on the scale of a one- and a two-zone building models. The Dufort-Frankel scheme has the benefits of being unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(dt^2) and to compute explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty, as well as it may enable perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation.",

On one hand, our model is based on very basic conservation principles. On the other hand, the turbulent nature of the flow is also taken into account through the energy dissipation mechanism. Moreover, the mixing with the pure water along with sediments entrainment and deposition processes are considered, which makes the problem dynamically interesting. One of the main advantages of our model is that it requires the specification of only two modeling parameters - the rate of turbulent dissipation and the rate of the pure water entrainment. Consequently, the resulting model turns out to be very simple and self-consistent. This model is validated against several experimental data and several special classes of solutions (such as travelling, self-similar and steady) are constructed. Unsteady simulations show that some special solutions are realized as asymptotic long time states of dynamic trajectories.",

Then, a semi-analytical numerical method is presented. It is based on a mapping technique and a finite difference scheme in the transformed domain. The idea is to pose the equations on a fixed domain. This method is thoroughly tested and validated in our study. By choosing specific values of spring parameters, this system can be used to damp (or in other words to extract the energy of) incident water waves.",

      "abstract": "Implicit schemes have been extensively used in building physics to compute the solution of moisture diffusion problems in porous materials for improving stability conditions. Nevertheless, these schemes require important sub-iterations when treating non-linear problems. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper explores the use of improved explicit schemes, such as Dufort-Frankel, Crank-Nicolson and hyperbolisation approaches. A first case study has been considered with the hypothesis of linear transfer. The Dufort-Frankel, Crank-Nicolson and hyperbolisation schemes were compared to the classical Euler explicit scheme and to a reference solution. Results have shown that the hyperbolisation scheme has a stability condition higher than the standard Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition. The error of this schemes depends on the parameter \\tau representing the hyperbolicity magnitude added into the equation. The Dufort-Frankel scheme has the advantages of being unconditionally stable and is preferable for non-linear transfer, which is the second case study. Results have shown the error is proportional to O(\\Delta t). A modified Crank-Nicolson scheme has been proposed in order to avoid sub-iterations to treat the non-linearities at each time step. The main advantages of the Dufort-Frankel scheme are (i) to be twice faster than the Crank-Nicolson approach; (ii) to compute explicitly the solution at each time step; (iii) to be unconditionally stable and (iv) easier to parallelise on high-performance computer systems. Although the approach is unconditionally stable, the choice of the time discretisation $\\Delta t$ remains an important issue to accurately represent the physical phenomena.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a practical application of the concept of Optimal Experiment Design (OED) for the determination of properties of porous materials with in-situ measurements and an identification method. First, an experimental set-up was presented and used for the measurement of relative humidity within a wood fibre material submitted to single and multiple steps of relative humidity variation. Then, the application of OED enabled to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs. The OED search was performed using the Fisher information matrix and a priori knowledge of the parameters. It ensures to provide the best accuracy of the identification method and thus the estimated parameter. Optimal design results have been found for single steps from the relative humidity phi = 10 to 75%, with one sensor located at the position X between 4 and 6 cm, for the estimation of moisture permeability coefficients, while from phi = 75% to phi = 33%, with one sensor located at X° = 3 cm, for the estimation of the advection coefficient. The OED has also been applied for the identification of couples of parameters. A sample submitted to multiple relative humidity steps (phi = 10-75-33-75%) with a sensor placed at X° = 5 cm was found as the best option for determining both properties with the same experiment. These OED parameters have then been used for the determination of moisture permeability and advection coefficients. The estimated moisture permeability coefficients are twice higher than the a priori values obtained using standard methods. The advection parameter corresponds to the mass average velocity of the order of v = 0.01 mm/s within the material and may play an important role on the simulation of moisture front.",

In this Part IV we focus on numerical aspects while the model derivation was described in Part III. The algorithm we propose is based on the splitting approach. Namely, equations are decomposed on a uniform elliptic equation for the dispersive pressure component and a hyperbolic part of shallow water equations (on a sphere) with source terms. This algorithm is implemented as a two-step predictor-corrector scheme. On every step we solve separately elliptic and hyperbolic problems. Then, the performance of this algorithm is illustrated on model idealized situations with even bottom, where we estimate the influence of sphericity and rotation effects on dispersive wave propagation. The dispersive effects are quantified depending on the propagation distance over the sphere and on the linear extent of generation region. Finally, the numerical method is applied to a couple of real-world events. Namely, we undertake simulations of the Bulgarian 2007 and Chilean 2010 tsunamis. Whenever the data is available, our computational results are confronted with real measurements.",

In this part, we investigate the derivation of some long wave models on a deformed sphere. We propose first a suitable for our purposes formulation of the full Euler equations on a sphere. Then, by applying the depth-averaging procedure we derive first a new fully nonlinear weakly dispersive base model. After this step, we show how to obtain some weakly nonlinear models on the sphere in the so-called Boussinesq regime. We have to say that the proposed base model contains an additional velocity variable which has to be specified by a closure relation. Physically, it represents a dispersive correction to the velocity vector. So, the main outcome of our article should be rather considered as a whole family of long wave models.",

For the sake of conciseness of this review, we omit the unidirectional models and focus especially on some classical and improved Boussinesq-type and Serre-Green-Naghdi equations. Finally, we propose also a unified modelling framework which incorporates several well-known and some less known dispersive wave models. The present manuscript is the first part of a series of two papers. The second part will be devoted to the numerical discretization of a practically important model on moving adaptive grids.",

The regularised equations are non-dissipative, non-dispersive and possess a variational structure. Thus, the mass, the momentum and the energy are conserved. Hence, for instance, regularised hydraulic jumps are smooth and non-oscillatory. Another particularly interesting feature of this regularisation is that smoothed `shocks' propagates at exactly the same speed as the original discontinuous ones. The performance of the new model is illustrated numerically on some dam-break test cases, which are classical in the hyperbolic realm.",

This new model is formally derived using the method of asymptotic expansions by introducing appropriately chosen dimensionless variables. In our study the small parameter, known as the film parameter, is chosen as the ratio of the flow depth to the characteristic wavelength. A new Nusselt solution should be explained, taking into account the hydrodynamic free surface variations and the contributions of the higher order terms coming from temperature variation effects. Comparisons are made with numerical solutions of the full Fourier equations in a steady state frame. The flow and heat transfer are coupled through Marangoni and temperature dependent viscosity effects. Even if these effects have been considered separately before, here a fully coupled model is proposed. Another novelty consists in the asymptotic approach in contrast to the weighted residual approach which have been formerly applied to these problems.",

First, using the phase space analysis methods we describe all possible types of localized travelling waves. Then, we especially focus on the critical regime, where the surface tension is exactly balanced by the gravity force. We show that our long wave model with a critical Bond number admits stable travelling wave solutions with a singular crest. These solutions are usually referred to in the literature as peakons or peaked solitary waves. They satisfy the usual speed-amplitude relation, which coincides with Scott-Russel's empirical formula for solitary waves, while their decay rate is the same regardless their amplitude. Moreover, they can be of depression or elevation type independent of their speed. The dynamics of these solutions are studied as well.",

Thus, to overcome the discrepancies between the experimental and the numerical models, this paper proposes to include the moisture advection transfer in the governing equation. To solve the advection-diffusion differential equation, it is first proposed two efficient numerical schemes and their efficiencies are investigated for both linear and nonlinear cases. The first scheme, Scharfetter-Gummel (SG), presents a Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition but is more accurate and faster than the second scheme, the well-known Crank-Nicolson approach. Furthermore, the SG scheme has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserved. Then, to conclude, results of the convective moisture transfer problem obtained with the SG numerical scheme are compared to experimental data from the literature. The inclusion of an advective term in the model may clearly lead to better results than purely diffusive models.",

A nonlocal Hamiltonian system of model equations is derived using the Hamiltonian structure of the free surface water wave problem and the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. The system features gravitational and capillary effects, and when restricted to one-way propagation, the system reduces to the capillary Whitham equation. It is shown numerically that in various scaling regimes the Whitham equation gives a more accurate approximation of the free-surface problem for the Euler system than other models like the KdV, and Kawahara equation. In the case of relatively strong capillarity considered here, the KdV and Kawahara equations outperform the Whitham equation with surface tension only for very long waves with negative polarity.",

The present article should be considered as a review of some existing models and modelling approaches even if new results are presented as well. Namely, we derive the deep water analogue of the celebrated Serre-Green-Naghdi equations which have become the standard model in shallow water environments. The relation to existing models is discussed. Moreover, the multi-symplectic structure of these equations is reported as well. The results of this work can be used to develop various types of robust structure-preserving variational integrators in deep water. The methodology of constructing approximate models presented in this study can be naturally extrapolated to other physical flow regimes as well.",

Numerical comparisons with the Euler equations show that the new model is substantially more accurate than the classical Serre equations, specially for long time simulations and for large amplitudes.",

It aims at searching the best experimental conditions in terms of quantity and position of sensors and boundary conditions imposed to the material. These optimal conditions ensure to provide the maximum accuracy of the identification method and thus the estimated parameters. The search of the OED is done by using the Fisher information matrix and a priori knowledge of the parameters. The methodology is applied for two case studies. The first one deals with purely conductive heat transfer. The concept of optimal experiment design is detailed and verified with 100 inverse problems for different experiment designs. The second case study combines a strong coupling between heat and moisture transfer through a porous building material. The methodology presented is based on a scientific formalism for efficient planning of experimental work that can be extended to the optimal design of experiments related to other problems in thermal and fluid sciences.",

The model is derived from a variational principle by choosing an appropriate shallow water ansatz and imposing some constraints. Our derivation procedure does not explicitly involve any small parameter and is straightforward. The novel system is a non-dispersive non-hydrostatic extension of the classical Saint-Venant equations. A key feature of the new model is that, like the classical NSWE, it is hyperbolic and thus similar numerical methods can be used. We also propose a finite volume discretisation of the obtained hyperbolic system. Several test-cases are presented to highlight the added value of the new model. Some implications to tsunami wave modelling are also discussed.",

The method is illustrated by the study of capillary-gravity steady surface waves propagating in shallow water. We consider the (fully nonlinear, weakly dispersive) Serre-Green-Naghdi equations with surface tension, because it provides a tractable model that, in the same time, is not too simple so the interest of the method can be emphasised. In particular, we analyse a special class of solutions, the solitary waves, which play an important role in many fields of Physics. In capillary-gravity regime, there are two kinds of localised infinitely smooth travelling wave solutions -- solitary waves of elevation and of depression. However, if we allow the solitary waves to have an angular point, the ``zoology'' of solutions becomes much richer and the main goal of this study is to provide a complete classification of such singular localised solutions using the methods of the effective Algebraic Geometry.",

Namely, we analyse the celebrated Green-Naghdi equations, the integrable two-component Camassa-Holm equations and a new two-component system of Green-Naghdi type. In particular, we are interested in solitary and cnoidal-type solutions, as two most important classes of travelling waves that we encounter in applications. We provide a complete phase-plane analysis of all possible travelling wave solutions which may arise in these models. In particular, we show the existence of new type of solutions.",

      "abstract": "The water wave theory traditionally assumes the fluid to be perfect, thus neglecting all effects of the viscosity. However, the explanation of several experimental data sets requires the explicit inclusion of dissipative effects. In order to meet these practical problems, the theory of visco-potential flows has been developed (see P.-F. Liu & A. Orfila (2004) and D. Dutykh & F. Dias (2007)). Then, usually this formulation is further simplified by developing the potential in an entire series in the vertical coordinate and by introducing thus, the long wave approximation. In the present study we propose a derivation of dissipative Boussinesq equations which is based on asymptotic expansions of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (D2N) operator. Both employed methods yield the same system by different ways.",

We use the KdV soliton gas as a simplest analytically accessible model yielding major insight into the general properties of soliton gases in integrable systems. Two model problems are considered: (i) the propagation of a `trial' soliton through a one-component `cold' soliton gas consisting of randomly distributed solitons of approximately the same amplitude; and (ii) collision of two cold soliton gases of different amplitudes (soliton gas shock tube problem) leading to the formation of an incoherend dispersive shock wave. In both cases excellent agreement is observed between the analytical predictions of the soliton gas kinetics and the direct numerical simulations. Our results confirm relevance of the kinetic equation for solitons as a quantitatively accurate model for macroscopic non-equilibrium dynamics of incoherent soliton ensembles.",

The main novelty consists in the usage of high order local asymptotic analytical solutions in the vicinity of the shoreline. Namely, we use the analytical techniques introduced by S. Kovalevskaya and the analogy with the compressible gas dynamics (i.e. gas outflow problem into the vacuum). Our run-up algorithm covers all the possible cases of the wave slope on the shoreline and it incorporates the new analytical information in order to determine the shoreline motion to higher accuracy. The application of this algorithm is illustrated on several important practical examples. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the well-known analytical and experimental predictions.",

The two-phase SPH solver is then used to model a benchmark problem of liquid impact on a rigid wall. The results are compared with an incompressible Level Set solver. Furthermore, a wave impact on a rigid wall with a large entrained air pocket is modelled. The SPH simulation is initialised by the output of a fully non-linear potential flow solver.

For the sake of simplicity we model the hydrodynamics by a generalized forced Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation.

This extension is based on the well-known Bona-Smith-Nwogu trick which aims to improve the linear dispersion properties. We show that in the fully nonlinear setting it results in modifying the vertical acceleration. Even if this technique is well-known, the effect of this modification on the nonlinear properties of the model is not clear. The first goal of this study is to shed some light on the properties of solitary waves, as the most important class of nonlinear permanent solutions. Then, we propose a simple adaptive strategy to choose the optimal value of the free parameter at every instance of time. This strategy is validated by comparing the model prediction with the reference solutions of the full Euler equations and its classical counterpart. Numerical simulations show that the new adaptive model provides a much better accuracy for the same computational complexity.",

The main predictions of the D-cascade model are outlined and thoroughly discussed. Finally, the obtained theoretical results are validated by direct numerical simulations of the mKdV equation using the pseudo-spectral methods. A general good agreement is reported in this study.

First we give a brief overview of the existing theory which is mainly based on the hodograph transformation (Carrier & Greenspan, 1958). Then, using numerical simulations, we build on the work of Stefanakis et al. (2011) for an infinite sloping beach and we find that resonant run-up amplification of monochromatic waves is robust to spectral perturbations of the incoming wave and resonant regimes do exist for certain values of the frequency. In the setting of a finite beach attached to a constant depth region, resonance can only be observed when the incoming wavelength is larger than the distance from the undisturbed shoreline to the seaward boundary. Wavefront steepness is also found to play a role in wave run-up, with steeper waves reaching higher run-up values.",

We rewrite this equation in dimensionless form featuring only one dimensionless parameter kh, where k is the carrier wavenumber and h is the undisturbed fluid depth. We show that one-soliton solutions of the classical nonlinear Schrödinger equation are transformed into quasi-soliton solutions with slowly varying amplitude when the high-order terms are taken into consideration.

Some high resolution numerical results are presented in both integrable and nonintegrable cases. Moreover, the free surface elevation probability distribution is shown to be quasi-stationary. Finally, we employ the asymptotic methods along with the Monte-Carlo simulations in order to study quantitatively the dependence of some important statistical characteristics (such as the kurtosis and skewness) on the Stokes-Ursell number (which measures the relative importance of nonlinear effects compared to the dispersion) and also on the magnitude of the BBM term.",

Comparing energies for different geometries reveals that, for small widths, the angle of the fork plays no role. Motivated by this, we introduce a 1D effective model whose solutions agree well with the 2D simulations for kink and breather solutions. These exhibit two different behaviors: a kink crosses if it has sufficient energy; conversely a breather crosses when $v > 1 - omega$, where $v$ and $\\omega$ are respectively its velocity and frequency. This methodology can be generalized to more complex nonlinear wave models.",

      "abstract": "A highly accurate numerical scheme is presented for the Serre system of partial differential equations, which models the propagation of dispersive shallow water waves in the fully-nonlinear regime. The fully-discrete scheme utilizes the Galerkin / finite-element method based on smooth periodic splines in space, and an explicit fourth-order Runge-Kutta method in time. Computations compared with exact solitary and cnoidal wave solutions show that the scheme achieves the optimal orders of accuracy in space and time. These computations also show that the stability of this scheme does not impose restrictive conditions on the temporal step size. In addition, solitary, cnoidal, and dispersive shock waves are studied in detail using this numerical scheme for the Serre system and compared with the 'classical' Boussinesq system for small-amplitude shallow water waves. The results show that the interaction of solitary waves in the Serre system is more inelastic. The efficacy of the numerical scheme for modeling dispersive shocks is shown by comparison with asymptotic results. These results have application to the modeling of shallow water waves of intermediate or large amplitude, such as occurs in the nearshore zone.",

We study numerically the properties of this cascade such as the dependence of the spectrum shape on the initial excitation parameter (amplitude), perturbation magnitude and the size of the spectral domain. Most importantly we found that the inverse cascade is always accompanied by the direct one and they both form a very stable quasi-stationary structure in the Fourier space in the spirit of the FPU-like reoccurrence phenomenon. The formation of this structure is intrinsically related to the development of the nonlinear stage of the Modulational Instability (MI). These results can be used in several fields such as the internal gravity water waves, ion-acoustic waves in plasmas and others.",

We review some of the basic generation mechanisms as well as their simulation. In particular, we present a simple and computationally inexpensive model that describes the seabed displacement during an underwater earthquake. This model is based on the finite fault solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the kinematics of the rupturing process. We also consider an unusual source for tsunami generation: the sinking of a cruise ship. Then we review some aspects of tsunami run-up. In particular, we explain why the first wave of a tsunami is sometimes less devastating than the subsequent waves. A resonance effect can boost the waves that come later. We also look at a particular feature of the 11 March 2011 tsunami in Japan - the formation of macro-scale vortices - and show that these macro-scale vortices can be captured by the nonlinear shallow water equations.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we study the nonlinear dynamics of an axisymmetric disturbance to the laminar state in non-rotating Poiseuille pipe flows. In particular, we show that the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of coupled Camassa-Holm type equations. These support inviscid and smooth localized travelling waves, which are numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices that concentrate near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or wrap around the pipe axis (centre vortexons) in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012) for small and long-wave disturbances. Inviscid singular vortexons with discontinuous radial velocities are also numerically discovered as associated to special traveling waves with a wedge-type singularity, viz. peakons. Their existence is confirmed by an analytical solution of exponentially-shaped peakons that is obtained for the particular case of the uncoupled Camassa-Holm equations. The evolution of a perturbation is also investigated using an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme. We observe that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating vorticity in the form of wall vortexons. These can under go further splitting before viscosity dissipate them, leading to a slug of centre vortexons. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with Eyink (2008). The inviscid and smooth vortexon is similar to the nonlinear neutral structures derived by Walton (2011) and it may be a precursor to puffs and slugs observed at transition, since most likely it is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances.",

From linear wave theory, we know that the wave amplitude on a vertical wall is twice the incident wave amplitude with weakly nonlinear theories bringing small corrections to this result. In this present study, however, we show that certain simple wave groups may produce much higher run-ups than previously predicted, with particular incident wave frequencies resulting in run up heights exceeding the initial wave amplitude by a factor of 5, suggesting that the notion of the design wave used in coastal structure design may need to be revisited. The results presented in this study can be considered as a note of caution for practitioners, on one side, and as a challenging novel material for theoreticians who work in the field of extreme wave - coastal structure interaction.",

      "abstract": "Surface water waves in ideal fluids have been typically modeled by asymptotic approximations of the full Euler equations. Some of these simplified models lose relevant properties of the full water wave problem. One of them is the Galilean symmetry, which is not present in important models such as the BBM equation and the Peregrine (Classical Boussinesq) system. In this paper we propose a mechanism to modify the above mentioned classical models and derive new, Galilean invariant models. We present some properties of the new equations, with special emphasis on the computation and interaction of their solitary-wave solutions. The comparison with full Euler solutions shows the relevance of the preservation of Galilean invariance for the description of water waves.",

With the aim to shed further light on this matter, the emergence of breather-like coherent wave groups in long-crested random sea is here investigated by means of high-resolution spectral simulations of the fully nonlinear two-dimensional Euler equations. Our study is focused on parametrizing the structure of random wave fields with respect to the Benjamin--Feir index, which is a nondimensional measure of the energy localization in Fourier space. This choice is motivated by previous results, showing that extreme-wave activity in long-crested sea is highly sensitive to this parameter. It is found that coherent wave groups do develop within wave fields characterized by sufficiently narrow-banded spectra, and that such coherent structures closely match realizations of Kuznetsov--Ma breathes in Euler dynamics. The characteristic spatial and temporal scales of wave group dynamics, and the corresponding occurrence of extreme events, are quantified and discussed by mean of space-time autocorrelations of the surface elevation envelope and extreme events statistics.",

      "abstract": "Consideration is given to the influence of an underwater landslide on waves at the surface of a shallow body of fluid. The equations of motion which govern the evolution of the barycenter of the landslide mass include various dissipative effects due to bottom friction, internal energy dissipation, and viscous drag. The surface waves are studied in the Boussinesq scaling, with time-dependent bathymetry. A numerical model for the Boussinesq equations is introduced which is able to handle time-dependent bottom topography, and the equations of motion for the landslide and surface waves are solved simultaneously. The numerical solver for the Boussinesq equations can also be restricted to implement a shallow-water solver, and the shallow-water and Boussinesq configurations are compared. A particular bathymetry is chosen to illustrate the general method, and it is found that the Boussinesq system predicts larger wave run-up than the shallow-water theory in the example treated in this paper. It is also found that the finite fluid domain has a significant impact on the behavior of the wave run-up.",

      "abstract": "We present a study on the nonlinear dynamics of small long-wave disturbances to the laminar state in non-rotating axisymmetric Poiseuille pipe flows. At high Reynolds numbers, the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of coupled Korteweg-de Vries-type (KdV) equations that support inviscid and smooth travelling waves numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices concentrated near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or that wrap around the pipe axis (centre vortexons), in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012). The KdV dynamics of a perturbation is also investigated by means of an high accurate Fourier-based numerical scheme. We observe that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating patches of vorticity near the wall. These can undergo further splitting leading to a proliferation of centre vortexons that eventually decay due to viscous effects. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with the inverse cascade of cross-stream vorticity identified in channel flows by Eyink (2008). The inviscid vortexon most likely is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances and may be a precursor to puffs and slug flow formation.",

First of all, we propose a simple and computationally inexpensive model for the description of the sea bed displacement during an underwater earthquake, based on the finite fault solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the dynamics of the rupturing process. Once the bottom motion is reconstructed, we study waves induced on the free surface of the ocean. For this purpose we consider three different models approximating the Euler equations of the water wave theory. Namely, we use the linearized Euler equations (we are in fact solving the Cauchy-Poisson problem), a Boussinesq system and a novel weakly nonlinear model. An intercomparison of these approaches is performed. The developments of the present study are illustrated on the 17 July 2006 Java event, where an underwater earthquake of magnitude 7.7 generated a tsunami that inundated the southern coast of Java.",

Special traveling wave solutions of this compact equation are numerically constructed using the Petviashvili method. Their stability properties are also investigated. Further, unstable traveling waves with wedge-type singularities, viz. peakons, are numerically discovered. To gain insights into the properties of singular traveling waves, we consider the academic case of a perturbed version of the compact equation, for which analytical peakons with exponential shape are derived. Finally, by means of an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme it is found that smooth solitary waves appear to collide elastically, suggesting the integrability of the Zakharov equation.",

      "abstract": "The main reason for the generation of tsunamis is the deformation of the bottom of the ocean caused by an underwater earthquake. Usually, only the vertical bottom motion is taken into account while the horizontal co-seismic displacements are neglected in the absence of landslides. In the present study we propose a methodology based on the well-known Okada solution to reconstruct in more details all components of the bottom coseismic displacements. Then, the sea-bed motion is coupled with a three-dimensional weakly nonlinear water wave solver which allows us to simulate a tsunami wave generation. We pay special attention to the evolution of kinetic and potential energies of the resulting wave while the contribution of the horizontal displacements into wave energy balance is also quantified. Such contribution of horizontal displacements to the tsunami generation has not been discussed before, and it is different from the existing approaches. The methods proposed in this study are illustrated on the July 17, 2006 Java tsunami and some more recent events.",

The method is based on a 'relaxed' variational principle, i.e., on a Lagrangian involving as many variables as possible. This formulation is particularly suitable for the construction of approximate water wave models, since it allows more freedom while preserving the variational structure. The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability) in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being well-known, other being new. The models obtained are studied analytically and exact travelling wave solutions are constructed when possible.",

Most of the analytical and numerical studies are limited to a constant slope plain shore and to the classical Nonlinear Shallow Water (NSW) equations. However, in nature the shore is characterized by some roughness. In order to take into account the effects of the bottom rugosity various ad-hoc friction terms are usually used. In this paper we study the effect of the roughness of the bottom on the maximum runup height. A stochastic model is proposed to describe the bottom irregularity and its effect is quantified using Monte-Carlo simulations. For the discretization of the NSW equations we employ modern finite volume schemes. Moreover, the results of the random bottom model are compared with the more conventional approaches.",

      "abstract": "Until now the analysis of long wave runup on a plane beach has been focused on finding its maximum value, failing to capture the existence of resonant regimes. One-dimensional numerical simulations in the framework of the Nonlinear Shallow Water Equations (NSWE) are used to investigate the Boundary Value Problem (BVP) for plane and non-trivial beaches. Monochromatic waves, as well as virtual wave-gage recordings from real tsunami simulations, are used as forcing conditions to the BVP. Resonant phenomena between the incident wavelength and the beach slope are found to occur, which result in enhanced runup of non-leading waves. The evolution of energy reveals the existence of a quasi-periodic state for the case of sinusoidal waves, the energy level of which, as well as the time required to reach that state, depend on the incident wavelength for a given beach slope. Dispersion is found to slightly reduce the value of maximum runup, but not to change the overall picture. Runup amplification occurs for both leading elevation and depression waves.",

In this study we present a novel model for the simulation of avalanches in the aerosol regime. The second scope of this study is to get more insight into the interaction process between an avalanche and a rigid obstacle. An incompressible model of two miscible fluids can be successfully employed in this type of problems. We allow for mass diffusion between two phases according to the Fick's law. The governing equations are discretized with a contemporary fully implicit finite volume scheme. The solver is able to deal with arbitrary density ratios. Several numerical results are presented. Volume fraction, velocity and pressure fields are presented and discussed. Finally we point out how this methodology can be used for practical problems.",

      "abstract": "A novel tool for tsunami wave modelling is presented. This tool has the potential of being used for operational purposes: indeed, the numerical code \\VOLNA is able to handle the complete life-cycle of a tsunami (generation, propagation and run-up along the coast). The algorithm works on unstructured triangular meshes and thus can be run in arbitrary complex domains. This paper contains the detailed description of the finite volume scheme implemented in the code. The numerical treatment of the wet/dry transition is explained. This point is crucial for accurate run-up/run-down computations. Most existing tsunami codes use semi-empirical techniques at this stage, which are not always sufficient for tsunami hazard mitigation. Indeed the decision to evacuate inhabitants is based on inundation maps which are produced with this type of numerical tools. We present several realistic test cases that partially validate our algorithm. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental data are performed. Finally the main conclusions are outlined and the perspectives for future research presented.",

      "abstract": "In the present study we investigate analytically the process of velocity and energy relaxation in two-phase flows. We begin our exposition by considering the so-called six equations two-phase model [Ishii1975, Rovarch2006]. This model assumes each phase to possess its own velocity and energy variables. Despite recent advances, the six equations model remains computationally expensive for many practical applications. Moreover, its advection operator may be non-hyperbolic which poses additional theoretical difficulties to construct robust numerical schemes |Ghidaglia et al, 2001]. In order to simplify this system, we complete momentum and energy conservation equations by relaxation terms. When relaxation characteristic time tends to zero, velocities and energies are constrained to tend to common values for both phases. As a result, we obtain a simple two-phase model which was recently proposed for simulation of violent aerated flows [Dias et al, 2010]. The preservation of invariant regions and incompressible limit of the simplified model are also discussed. Finally, several numerical results are presented.",

The main scope here is to demonstrate and especially quantify the effect of sedimentation on vertical displacements of the seabed due to an underwater earthquake. The fault is modelled as a Volterra-type dislocation in an elastic half-space. The elastodynamics equations are integrated with a finite element method. A comparison between two cases is performed. The first one corresponds to the classical situation of an elastic homogeneous and isotropic half-space, which is traditionally used for the generation of tsunamis. The second test case takes into account the presence of a sediment layer separating the oceanic column from the hard rock. Some important differences are revealed. We conjecture that deformations in the generation region may be amplified by sedimentary deposits, at least for some parameter values. The mechanism of amplification is studied through careful numerical simulations.",

      "abstract": "In the study of ocean wave impact on structures, one often uses Froude scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or entrained air in the water can significantly modify wave impacts. When air is entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the water change dramatically. While some work has been done to study small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures, little work has been done on large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We propose a basic two-fluid model in which both fluids share the same velocities and analyze some of its properties. It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water wave impacts on coastal structures. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order finite volume method. Numerical results are presented for two examples: the dam break problem and the drop test problem. It is shown that this basic model can be used to study violent aerated flows, especially by providing fast qualitative estimates.",

      "abstract": "Water wave propagation can be attenuated by various physical mechanisms. One of the main sources of wave energy dissipation lies in boundary layers. The present work is entirely devoted to thorough analysis of the dispersion relation of the novel visco-potential formulation. Namely, in this study we relax all assumptions of the weak dependence of the wave frequency on time. As a result, we have to deal with complex integro-differential equations that describe transient behaviour of the phase and group velocities. Using numerical computations, we show several snapshots of these important quantities at different times as functions of the wave number. Good qualitative agreement with previous study [Dutykh2009] is obtained. Thus, we validate in some sense approximations made anteriorly. There is an unexpected conclusion of this study. According to our computations, the bottom boundary layer creates disintegrating modes in the group velocity. In the same time, the imaginary part of the phase velocity remains negative for all times. This result can be interpreted as a new kind of instability which is induced by the bottom boundary layer effect.",

From physical point of view, local dissipation terms come from molecular viscosity but in practical computations, rather eddy viscosity should be used. On the other hand, nonlocal dissipative term represents a correction due to the presence of a bottom boundary layer. Using the standard procedure of Boussinesq equations derivation, we come to nonlocal long wave equations. In this article we analyse dispersion relation properties of proposed models. The effect of nonlocal term on solitary and linear progressive waves attenuation is investigated. Finally, we present some computations with viscous Boussinesq equations solved by a Fourier type spectral method.",

It is shown that dispersive effects only appear at higher order in the energy budget. Then we solve the Cauchy-Poisson problem of tsunami generation for the linearized water wave equations.

The present study takes into account these dynamic effects. Earth's crust is assumed to be a Kelvin-Voigt material. The seismic source is assumed to be a dislocation in a viscoelastic medium. The fluid motion is described by the classical nonlinear shallow water equations (NSWE) with time-dependent bathymetry. The viscoelastodynamic equations are solved by a finite-element method and the NSWE by a finite-volume scheme. A comparison between static and dynamic tsunami-generation approaches is performed. The results of the numerical computations show differences between the two approaches and the dynamic effects could explain the complicated shapes of tsunami wave trains.",

For tsunamis generated by underwater earthquakes, it involves the modeling of the sea bottom motion as well as the resulting motion of the water above it. A comparison between various models for three-dimensional water motion, ranging from linear theory to fully nonlinear theory, is performed. It is found that for most events the linear theory is sufficient. However, in some cases, more sophisticated theories are needed. Moreover, it is shown that the passive approach in which the seafloor deformation is simply translated to the ocean surface is not always equivalent to the active approach in which the bottom motion is taken into account, even if the deformation is supposed to be instantaneous.",

      "abstract": "The computation of long wave propagation through the ocean obviously depends on the initial condition. When the waves are generated by a moving bottom, a traditional approach consists in translating the ``frozen'' sea bed deformation to the free surface and propagating it. The present study shows the differences between the classical approach (passive generation) and the active generation where the bottom motion is included. The analytical solutions presented here exhibit some of the drawbacks of passive generation. The linearized solutions seem to be sufficient to consider the generation of water waves by a moving bottom.",
