In a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system with a movable mirror, the proposed coherent feedback scheme allows for the enhancement of both bipartite and tripartite quantum correlations. Moreover, we demonstrate that the resulting entanglement remains robust with respect to ambient temperatures in the presence of coherent feedback control.",

      "abstract": "Using the spectral method, we investigate the scalar and axial quasinormal modes (QNMs) of massive static phantom wormholes. Our results reveal the existence of purely imaginary QNMs that were not identified in previous studies, suggesting potential (in)stabilities as the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius to the wormhole throat varies within a specific range. For scalar perturbations, instabilities arise when this ratio exceeds 1.0, with the threshold value of 1.0 itself included. In the case of axial perturbations, the onset of instability occurs at smaller ratios, reflecting the impact of gravitational waves on the wormhole's stability. The findings suggest that the wormhole remains stable when the throat size significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius. Our results align with existing literature but offer new insights into the stability conditions of phantom wormholes.",

      "abstract": "The dynamics of rotating shallow-water flows is a classical problem in geophysical fluid dynamics, with applications ranging from atmospheric and oceanic flows to astrophysical disks. In this work, we investigate the route to chaos and the role of resonant triads in a truncated rotating shallow-water model. The model is derived by projecting the full rotating shallow-water equations onto a finite-dimensional phase space, using a Galerkin expansion. We show that the truncated model exhibits a rich dynamical behavior, including the emergence of chaotic regimes. The transition to chaos is characterized by the appearance of period-doubling bifurcations and the onset of a strange attractor. We also analyze the role of resonant triadic interactions in the dynamics, and we show that they play a crucial role in the route to chaos. Specifically, we identify the resonant triads that are responsible for the onset of chaotic behavior, and we study their nonlinear interactions and energy exchanges. Our results provide new insights into the complex dynamics of rotating shallow-water flows and the mechanisms underlying the transition to chaos in geophysical fluid systems.",

Our findings not only challenge previous claims in the literature regarding the instability of these black holes but also reveal remarkable stability for both non-extreme and extreme Schwarzschild black holes under various perturbations.",

      "abstract": "The Lesser Antilles subduction zone marks the convergence between the Caribbean Plate and the oceanic Atlantic part of the America Plate. A specificity of this subduction is the development of a huge accretionary prism, the Barbados complex. As other subduction zones, the Lesser Antilles one has the potential to produce megathrust-associated earthquakes and related tsunamis. This study evaluates the potential hazard of tsunami scenarios along this eastern boundary of the Caribbean Plate, taking into account its specificities. We define six scenarios along the Lesser Antilles subduction zone including three M_w 7.5, 8.0 and 8.5 earthquake models, in both northern and southern parts of the arc. We incorporate in tsunami simulations the effect of sediment amplification in tsunami generation. In the southern half, the thick sediments pile, related to tectonic accretion, appears much more effective than the much thinner accumulation characterizing the northern half. The bed shear stress is also computed in this study as it is an important factor in sediment transport which can show the potential locations for sediment movement by tsunamis. Our results indicate the ability of scenario earthquakes to produce powerful tsunamis. The impacts of northern scenarios on Guadeloupe could be severe (maximum tsunami wave height of > 5 m ), whereas the impacts from southern scenarios are relatively less strong (maximum wave amplitude of < 5 m ). The tsunami waves produced by M_w 8.0 and 8.5 appear able to inundate the coast of Sainte-Anne, Guadeloupe, up to 2 km . The distributions of bed shear stress from northern scenarios suggest that the offshore Leeward Islands could be potentially prone to sediment transport as possible tsunami deposits have been found in the region in former geological studies.",

We briefly recall how this family is correlated to the problem of Lehmer. A variety of questions is raised about their numbers of zeroes in 𝔽p and their factorizations, via Kronecker's Average Value Theorem (viewed as an analog of classical Theorems of Uniform Distribution Theory). These questions are partially answered using results of Schinzel, revisited by Sawin, Shusterman and Stoll, and density theorems (Frobenius, Chebotarev, Serre, Rosen). These questions arise from the search for the existence of integer polynomials of Mahler measure > 1 less than the smallest Salem number 1.176280. Explicit connection with modular forms (or modular representations) of the numbers of zeroes of these polynomials in 𝔽p is obtained in a few cases. In general it is expected since it must exist according to the Langlands program.",
